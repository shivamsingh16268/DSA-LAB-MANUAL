# PRACTISING 2D ARRAYS FOR REAL-WORLD TABULAR DATA AND UNDERSTAND TRAVERSAL COMPLEXITY.

# 2-D ARRAY : A two-dimensional (2D) array is an array of arrays, organizing data into rows and columns like
#             a table or matrix. Elements are accessed using two indices: one for the row and one for the column.

# ANSWER : 

# defining a function print_matrix taking a matrix as an input 
def print_matrix(matrix):
    for row in matrix: # traversing each row of the matrix

        # map(str,row) : converts numbers from int form to string form in a list [10,12]->['10','12']
        # ' '.join() : connects the string formed in map to string with spaces ('10 20')
        # and printing the final output
        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))

    # looping through the matrix using enumerate
    ''' 
        enumerate(matrix) : is a python built-in function that iterated over a matrix (a list of list), 
        yielding pairs of an index and each row for easy access to row positions. 

        eg :- For matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]], the loop for i, row in enumerate(matrix): gives:
        i=0, row=[1, 2]
        i=1, row=[3, 4]
        i=2, row=[5, 6] 
    '''
    for i, row in enumerate(matrix):
        total = sum(row)  # adding all the elements of the row of the matrix
        print(f"Row {i}: {total}")  # printing each row total sum with the row index.

# defining a function columns_sums that will sum the elements of the columns in
# the matrix and takes a matrix as an input

            columns_total=columns_total+matrix[i][j]  # adding the cells 
        print(f"Col {j}: {columns_total}")  # printing the total with the column numbers
        
# defining the search_value function for searching values in the matrix that takes 
# matrix and target element as an input

            if matrix[i][j] == target: # if element is found
